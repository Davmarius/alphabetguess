# alphabetguess
This is an original game I created for my son to test how well he knew his letters in alphabetical order and add a little problem solving challenge to the mix. 
This has very basic javascript skills that include: opening and closing pop up modals, very basic styling with CSS, and using DOM. I hope that you have fun playing the game and also look forward to see what is done to make it better.
